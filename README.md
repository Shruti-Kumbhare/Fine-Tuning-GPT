Fine-Tuning GPT Model

Welcome to the Fine-Tuning-GPT project! This project focuses on training a language model to generate positive and motivational self-affirmations. The model can be used to provide uplifting messages and boost confidence.

Overview:

This repository provides the essential tools and code to fine-tune a language model suitable for generating self-affirmations. The model is adaptable to various fine-tuning approaches, and the data was generated using ChatGPT. By substituting the data.jsonl file, you can effortlessly tailor the fine-tuning process to your specific objectives. Additionally, note that advanced utilization of the model mandates an OpenAI subscription with a paid plan.

Project Structure:

- `train.py`: The main script for fine-tuning (training of) the language model.
- `upload.py`: The main script for fine-tuning the language model.
- `data.jsonl`: Sample dataset in the required format for training.
- `README.txt`: You are here!

Usage:

Once the model has been fine-tuned, it can be employed to generate self-affirmations enriched with positive messages. To utilize the model, input a user query centred around self-affirmation. The model will then generate an affirmative and uplifting response.

Feel free to adapt the fine-tuning process to your preferred model. For this project, ChatGPT was utilized to create the training data. Adjusting the data.jsonl file allows you to tailor the fine-tuning to your specific needs.

Please note that usage of the model necessitates a paid OpenAI subscription plan.
